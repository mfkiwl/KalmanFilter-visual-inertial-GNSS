# KalmanFilter-visual-inertial-GNSS
This is an extended Kalman filter for inertial-GNSS (currently) and visual-inertial-GNSS (ultimately) sensor fusion.
The filter will be tested on an agri-machinery or vehicle for self-navigation and realising precise agriculture.
The hardware of the test includes an Intel D455 depth camera with a built-in Bosch 6-DoF (accelerometer & gyroscope) IMU and a Chinese-manufactured GNSS module from NongXin.
